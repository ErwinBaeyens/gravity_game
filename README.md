# Gravity Game

This is a rewrite of the gravity game as presented in the book "physics for game programmers".  The goal of the game is to get the ball in the box. 

The book presents the programs in C#, C and java. The C version is non graphical. Both the java and C# versions use a simple graphical interface. 
I do not like Java and as I'm running linux C# is not a realistic option to run it.  Therfore I'm trying to rewrite the program using Python.
